# Wapi Daktari: Public Healthcare Crowd-Management System

## Project Overview

Wapi Daktari is a public healthcare crowd-management and awareness system designed to help ordinary Kenyans, especially walk-in patients at public hospitals, by predicting the best time to visit a hospital based on past patterns of doctor availability, patient traffic, and waiting times. The system provides real-time predictions via a simple USSD interface, ensuring that patients receive timely and actionable insights without the need for an app or account.

## Problem

Most Kenyans visiting public hospitals don’t know if the doctor is available, how long the wait will be, or if they'll even be seen. This uncertainty wastes time, discourages care-seeking, and overloads hospitals randomly. There’s no access to real-time hospital insights—especially for low-income patients without smartphones or internet access.

## Objective

To empower walk-in patients at public hospitals with data-backed predictions on the best time to visit—via a simple USSD interface that works on any phone. The goal is to reduce wasted time, manage hospital congestion, and improve access to care without requiring logins or apps.
